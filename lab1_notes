The 16-bit Intel processor is capable of addressing only 1MB of physical memory(0x00000000 to 0x000FFFFF). The lower 640KB is the RAM. The BIOS is in the top 64KB of the 1MB addressable physical memory. The BIOS is responsible for basic system initialization and checking the amount of memory installed. The BIOS intializes devices, sets of the interrupt routines and reads the first sector of the boot device into memory and jumps to it. After this initialization the BIOS loads the operating system from the disk and transfers the control of the machine to the operating system.
Even the newer PCs have the layout for the low 1MB of the physical memory reserved for backward compatibility. So there is a hole from 640KB to 1MB with the RAM divided into the lower 640KB and the upper extended memory. Some space at the top of this 32 bit address sapce is reserved for the BIOS.
The BIOS gets control of the machine after power-up or system restart as there is no other software in the PCs RAM which the processor can execute.
The QEMU comes with its own BIOS which it will load at the processor's simulated physical address space and will set the CS to 0xf000 and the IP to 0xfff0 so the execution will start from 16*0xF000 + 0xFFF0 = 0xFFFF0.
The JOS will use 256MB of physical memory. The PC execution starts right at the top of the BIOS section from 0x00FFFF0. The first instruction it performs is to jump to a previous location in the BIOS
